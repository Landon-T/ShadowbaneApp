# ShadowbaneApp

This Android application is used to create builds and templates for characters. The goal of the app is to provide a fun
way to build characters while out of the game.

Furture plans are to add in timers and notfacations for disipline and Vorgim dropper spawns. Potentially turn the app into a mobile Wiki.
